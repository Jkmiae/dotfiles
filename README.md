Debud of my Linux Rice dotfile.
I'm still a beginner and this is my first Rice, so expect to have to tweak some scripts. However, several Reddit users asked me to share it, so here it is!

For the theme to work correctly, you must install the `wal` package:

https://github.com/dylanaraps/wal

and run:

```
wal -i "path/to/your/wallpaper" -n -q
kitty @ set-colors -a "~/.cache/wal/colors-kitty.conf"
```
